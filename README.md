## Statement
This study focuses on the stem-leaf segmentation of corn point cloud data and the measurement of leaf phenotypic parameters. By leveraging innovative technical methods, it converts high-precision 3D point cloud data into key information that reflects the growth status of corn, thereby providing core support for field management decision-making in precision agriculture and the optimization of intelligent breeding.The proposed multi-feature fusion adaptive segmentation algorithm not only breaks through the bottlenecks of traditional methods—such as low accuracy and poor robustness in stem-leaf segmentation under complex field environments (e.g., light changes, leaf overlap)—but also significantly improves segmentation efficiency and the accuracy of parameter measurement.This study has developed a comprehensive evaluation framework for corn phenotypic research, and has publicly shared the dataset and algorithm code repository. This initiative not only breaks down the barriers to the sharing of agricultural digital resources and promotes the interoperability of resources across teams and fields, but also advances the construction of a collaborative and transparent agricultural digital ecosystem.
